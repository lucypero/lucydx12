# current todo
- just draw a red screen sized quad for the lighting pass, as a test.
- deferred rendering: a second PSO for the final render.
- set up some basic allocator stuff
    - set up a tracking allocator for lasting allocations.

- experiment with `setpipelinestate`. see what u can delete after using that.


# possible cool goals:

- blinn phong lighting (just need to add some stuff to the shader to accomplish this)
- deferred rendering (read it in book) (page 883)

- seems like a general dx12 guide. check it out:
